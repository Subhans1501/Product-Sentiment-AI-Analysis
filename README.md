# 🤖 Product Sentiment AI Analysis
Developed for the **Programming for AI (AL-2001)** course at **FAST-NUCES (Fall 2024)**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive sentiment analysis of product selling websites. The goal is to scrape historical data, perform data manipulation, and present results using advanced Python libraries.

## Key Features & Workflow
**Data Cleaning & Structuring:** Implemented a custom `CryptoData` class to organize scraped data into a structured format.
**Data Transformation:** Used **NumPy** to calculate rolling averages of sentiment and product reviews.
**Statistical Analysis:** Used **Pandas** to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for brand sentiment and correlated trends between brands.
**Visualization:** Generated line and bar charts for trends over time, alongside pie charts for sentiment distribution (Positive, Neutral, and Negative).



## 💻 Technical Implementation
**OOP Principles:** Adheres to strict Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism).
**Persistence:** All cleaned and transformed data is saved to CSV format for future reference.
**Documentation:** Thoroughly commented code explaining each step of the sentiment analysis process.
